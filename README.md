# 🛠️ VLSI Internship Tasks – Beginner Level Projects
As part of the VLSI internship program, I was assigned a set of 6 design tasks to strengthen my fundamentals in digital design using Verilog HDL.
This repository contains my initial two implementations — DIGITAL LOGIC DESIGN WITH VERILOG and a FINITE STATE MACHINE (FSM) DESIGN .
These beginner-level projects helped me get hands-on experience with Verilog coding, simulation, and understanding digital circuit behavior.

## 🚀 Tools & Languages Used
- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx Vivado 

## ✅ Completed Tasks
### 📌 Task 1 – DIGITAL LOGIC DESIGN WITH VERILOG
- Designed a basic digital logic circuits like logic gates,universal gates, adders, and multiplexers using Verilog.
- Verified the output using a testbench.
- Observed waveform outputs through simulation.

### 📌 Task 2 – FINITE STATE MACHINE (FSM) DESIGN 
- Implemented a FSM machines that is moore,and melay models in Verilog.
- Verified the functionality via simulation.
- Designed basic testbench to ensure correct logic operation.
